# Upgrading 2.x to 3.x

NOTE: 
You will need to do this in 2 steps:
1st step: 2.6 to 3.3.8 (latest 3.x)
2nd step: [V 3.x to v 4.x](3to4)


### Upgrading 2.x to 3.x notes
- You might want to look at moving to unobtrusive mode in your upgrade for reduced coupling in your code.
- The format of saga persistence changes in SQL server for enumerated types, under V2 they were stored by “name” and under V3 the value (i.e. 1,2,3,4) of the enumeration is stored in the database table. 
- Timeouts migration is described here :http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/migrating-to-nservicebus-3.0-timeouts
- The DI abstraction in V2 would inject into a property declared “public static”, but under V3 it won’t inject into a static property. If you’ve got static properties that are “working” under V2, they will be null under V3 until you make them not static.
